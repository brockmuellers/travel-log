I spent so much time trying to match species in the GBIF dataset to my inaturalist observations. The dataset was ostensibly of inaturalist observations, so you'd think they would match up neatly. In the end I had to go back to my initial plan of using the inaturalist API to get species observation counts. Maybe the GBIF dataset processing script will be useful for something else, but I did learn a bit about taxonomy and working with messy data sources. (If only I were a data scientist - this would be much easier!)

My data directory is getting quite messy - lots of scripts, datasets, data downloads, and intermediate products. It's unclear what depends on what. This will cease to be feasible soon. I'm also repeating "deploy" logic in different scripts.
