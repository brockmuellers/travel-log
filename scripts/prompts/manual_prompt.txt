PROMPT

I am uploading a blog post, which should be written in chronological order, about a segment of our trip. I'm also uploading a json file of "waypoints" (major stops in the country) and their approximate arrival dates, with waypoints ordered by date.

Please read the blog post and generate a first-person, 1-5-sentence summary for each waypoint based only on the text (the more text there is about the waypoint, the longer the summary will be).

Special cases:
- It's possible that locations are visited multiple times - in that case, there will be multiple waypoints with the same or similar names, but different dates.
- If the waypoint name does not have a specific mention in the blog, attempt to identify blog commentary on the waypoint by chronological order and context. If you determine that the waypoint isn't mentioned in the blog, write 'No specific mention.'
- When there is notable information about the travel between two waypoints, it should be included in the summary for the destination waypoint, if possible.

CRITICAL: in a code block, output a json file. It should be equivalent to the input json file but adding a `"summary"` property that records your summary for each waypoint. After that, below the code block, give me a summary of any confusions/ambiguities you encountered, and notes about your process.
